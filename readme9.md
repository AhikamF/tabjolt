## What is Tabjolt?

TabJolt is a "Point and Run" load generator specifically designed for Tableau Server and uses JMeter under the covers. It helps you (Tableau Server Administrators) to accelerate load testing of your Tableau Server deployment for golive. It uses JMeter for load generation, but eliminates the need to record workloads. You can simply point TabJolt to your published visualizations and it will automatically drive user specified loads for any duration. 

## When to use TabJolt?

There are many scenario's TabJolt can be used for, but primarily here are the key questions it will help you answer:

1. I want to deploy a brand new Tableau Server, how will server scale on my hardware and workload? 
2. I am moving from Tableau Server 8.x to version 9.0, given my workbooks and hardware, how will 9.0 scale in my environment compared to 8.x?
3. Under Tableau's guidance, I want to tune my server configuration given my hardware and workbooks and environments, how do I measure and monitor the affects of configuration changes to select the best configuration?
